The Foundation Agent should be scaled across 3 axes:
1. Skills: the amount of tasks it can solve;
2. Embodiments: the diversity of body forms it can control; 
3. Realities: the number of worlds, virtual or physical, that the agent can master. This includes games, simulations, and real-world scenarios with different mechanics and rules.

Why do we want a single Foundation Agent instead of many smaller models? I'd like to quote the idea from my friend Prof.

's CoRL keynote talk. If we trace each AI field's evolution, we'd find this pattern:

Specialist -> Generalist -> Specializing Generalist

And the "specialized generalist" is often way more powerful than the original specialist. Just like distilled versions of LlaMA are way better than custom-built NLP systems 5 years ago.
